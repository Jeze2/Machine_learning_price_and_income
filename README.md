# Machine_learning_price_and_income
## Summary
- This project aims to predict the price of wine based on different properties of the wine. The data contains information on various wines including variety, winery, location, alcohol content, and other chemical properties.
## Business Problem
- Wine producers want to determine fair pricing for their wines based on properties like variety, origin, chemical composition, expert ratings, etc. Setting the right prices is important for wineries to maximize profit margins and compete effectively in the wine market.
## Stakeholders
- Wine producers: Need to price wines optimally based on production costs and market factors
- Wine distributors: Need to understand pricing trends to stock the correct wine inventory
- Wine retailers: Need competitive pricing strategy to attract consumers and maximize sales
- Consumers: Want to know they are getting quality wines at fair prices
## Source of Data
- The data was obtained from the Spanish Wine Quality Dataset on Kaggle. It contains [n] samples of Spanish red and white wines with [m] features including:
-  Variety, country, winery, Location, Expert ratings, Alcohol content, pH levels, Acidity, and more.
- The goal is to use the chemical and physical properties of the wines to predict the price. This is an important business goal for wineries to determine optimal pricing for their products. The data provides an interesting modeling challenge due to the mix of numerical and categorical features.
